            <p font-size: 100x>I’m someone who enjoys exploring a variety of interests, from sports to the arts. 
                I’ve been an active basketball player, having participated in several competitions such as inter-house, inter-school, and district-level events, 
                and I was also a proud member of my school team. 
                <br><br>Beyond sports, I’ve found success in debate, where I secured a first-place finish. 
                My love for creativity has led me to participate in numerous art workshops and competitions, both within and outside of school, while also being part of my school’s music choir.
                 <br><br>In my free time, I enjoy reading, sketching, decorating, and occasionally writing short stories.
                 I also have a passion for adventure and hope to try extreme sports like bungee jumping and paragliding. 
                 While I enjoy being active, I also deeply value moments of peace and quiet, where I can unwind and enjoy some alone time.
